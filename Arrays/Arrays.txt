What is array?
    Arrays are basic data structure that stores values of same "Data type", 
    so if you are storing integers you have to keep storing integers and you cannot store a string in it.
In Python you have to import the module "array" to use array.
We will do some problems to practice array and I will explain how I solved the problem.

Types of codes to create arrays are:
Typecode	Type	                Minimum Size in Bytes
‘b’	      Signed integer	                1
‘B’	      Unsigned integer	                1
‘i’	      Signed integer	                2
‘I’	      Unsigned integer	                2
‘1’	      Signed integer	                4
‘L’	      Unsigned integer	                4
‘f’	      Floating points	                4
‘d’	      Double floating points (decimals)	8
‘u’	      Unicode characters	            2
