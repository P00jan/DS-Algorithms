What is array?
    Arrays are basic data structure that stores values of same "Data type", 
    so if you are storing integers you have to keep storing integers and you cannot store a string in it.
In Python you have to import the module "array" to use array.
We will do some problems to practice array and I will explain how I solved the problem.
